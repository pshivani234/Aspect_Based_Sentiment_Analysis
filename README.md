Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a technique in natural language processing 
(NLP) that we used to identify sentiment at the granular level of specific aspects or 
features of a product. Unlike traditional sentiment analysis, which classifies entire texts 
as positive, negative, or neutral, we focused on identifying sentiments associated with 
specific aspects mentioned within a review. For instance, in a product review, aspects like 
"design" or "power consumption" were analysed separately, and we determined the 
sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) towards each aspect. This detailed feature 
analysis helped understand customer opinions in depth, providing valuable insights for 
businesses.
The process of ABSA involved several key steps: aspect extraction, sentiment detection, 
and classification. We first extracted the features or attributes discussed in the text, such 
as "design" or "power consumption." with 93% accuracy. Next, we detected the 
sentiment polarity expressed towards these aspects, categorizing them into positive, 
negative, or neutral classes with 81% accuracy. Finally, we classified the sentiment 
accordingly, enabling businesses to understand specific strengths and weaknesses of their 
products. Through this in-depth analysis, we aimed to help companies improve specific 
product features and address customer concerns more effectively, ultimately leading to 
enhanced customer satisfaction and better product development.
